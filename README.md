# 🎄 Advent of Code – Python Solutions

Welcome to my repository of solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), an annual set of festive programming challenges that run each December. These puzzles are great for sharpening problem-solving skills and experimenting with new approaches.

## 🐍 About This Repo

- 🔧 **Language:** Python (for now!)
- 📆 **Years:** 2022, 2023, 2024 *(work in progress)*
- ✅ **Goal:** Practice algorithms, improve Python fluency, and have some fun solving challenges.
- 🚧 **Status:** Not all days are completed — I’m working through them over time to keep my skills sharp.
- 🦀 **Future Plan:** I’m aiming to revisit and reimplement many of these in **Rust** as a way to build up my systems programming skills and explore a new paradigm.

Each year is organized into folders like so:
📁 2022/ 📁 2023/ 📁 2024/

Each folder contains:
- Input `.txt` files (and sometimes testing `.txt`)
- One Python file per day, named by the day (e.g. `Day5.py`)

## 📌 Why I Do This

Advent of Code helps me:
- Practice writing clean, efficient Python
- Think through problems from multiple angles
- Keep coding fun and consistent
- Explore new languages like Rust

## 🚀 How to Run

To run a solution for a specific day (example from 2024 Day 5):

```bash
cd 2024/Day5
python Day5.py
